# Radius
r <- 2
# Function to compute the volume of a sphere with radius r
volume <- function(r, rho) {
 3/4*pi*r^2
}
# Function to compute the volumes of the spheres with radius r, r^2 and 
r^3 
volume_vector <- function(r) {
 r <- 22
 for (r in 2:4){
 volume(r)
 }
}
# Run volume_vector(r) and print the volumes of the spheres with radius 
r, r^2 and r^3 
volume_vector(r
